<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

this is the project file for the backend in other words it is a restful api which has all the basic functionality of a restful api.

Feature:
* Get data from database mysql
* Post data from database
* Patch data (edit/update file) from database
* Delete data from database
* Register for new user
* Log in for user
* Hash data password
* Redis to improve performance

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
